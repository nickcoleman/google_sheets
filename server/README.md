## Keys

You'll need to generate a root level keys.json file with the following structure. If you use multiple sheet files, each would need their own keys.json file. This file is created when you generate your credentials.

```
  {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "",
    "private_key_id": "",
    "private_key": "",
    "client_email": "",
    "client_id": "",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "",
    "spreadsheet_id": ""  # note field was manually added and is taken from the actual google sheet
  }
```

The keys.json file can be generated from your project cloud.google.com console
